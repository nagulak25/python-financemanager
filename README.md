# To-Do List Application

## Project Overview
This is a simple command-line to-do list application built with Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to manage tasks by adding, removing, listing, and marking them as complete. The project demonstrates beginner-level OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

### Goals and Objectives
- Provide a functional CLI tool for task management.
- Teach OOP basics: Classes (e.g., `Task`, `ToDoList`), inheritance , and methods.
- Ensure the code is modular, testable, and easy to extend.
